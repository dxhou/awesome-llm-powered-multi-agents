Today, with the vigorous development of large models, the "old dream" of human beings about multi-agent interaction has become a reality. 

This project focuses on building an inventory of creations related to various aspects of multi-agents, including papers, repositories and more. 🌟We will regularly and continuously update the latest things.
We greatly look forward to any contributions in various ways. Hope and believe that you will enjoy it! 💫
